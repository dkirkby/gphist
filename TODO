TODO:

- Do not use "NLL" terminology for "posterior probability" to avoid confusion.
- Add curves for DH0,DA0.
- Option to write json file to configure web display of plots
- Add javascript and html to display plots
- Implement conformal time as new evolution variable.
- Implement an alternate GP kernel.
- Test that an expansion history different from DH0 can be recovered w/o bias.
- Check memory usage and avoid copies of large DH,DA arrays.
- Implement Omega_de(z) plots.
- When h is large and sigma is small, the DA prior is no longer compatible with DA0.
  How should this be handled?
- Use an external config file (json?) to set posteriors, including redshifts.
