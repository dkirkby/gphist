TODO:

- Add plot of H(z)/(1+z) on linear z scale from 0-3. No new histograms needed for this?
- Save some random samples of each posterior from infer.py and optionally display them in plot.py
- Option to write plots for all combinations of posteriors in plot.py in batch mode, together with a json file to configure web display of plots
- Add javascript and html to display plots
