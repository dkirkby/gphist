TODO:

- Traverse hyperparameter grid with sigma increasing fastest to even out split job run times.
- Save z for each realization.
- Downsample realizations in infer and plot.
- Add a point at 1 for DA/DA0 curve?
- Add curves for DH0,DA0.
- Option to write json file to configure web display of plots
- Add javascript and html to display plots
- Implement conformal time as new evolution variable.
- Implement an alternate GP kernel.
- Test that an expansion history different from DH0 can be recovered w/o bias.
- Use an external config file (json?) to set posteriors, including redshifts.
- Always use same fine grid to calculate DA0 to avoid O(1e-4) differences with sigma.
- Add a --zhist plot.py option to draw histograms at zhist (with interpolation?)
- Replace DA with DM throughout?
- Find min of NLP(h,sigma) using interpolation
